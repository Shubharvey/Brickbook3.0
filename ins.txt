# Implementation Notes & File Sharing

I have generated a complete, standalone version of the **Accounts** feature you requested. This includes:

1.  **Accounts.tsx**: The main dashboard with Location/Category hierarchy, Search, and Bulk Add.
2.  **AccountDetail.tsx**: The individual profile page with transaction history.
3.  **AccountsContext.tsx**: A context provider to handle the data logic (Add/Delete/Search) locally for this demo.

## How to Integrate with your Existing Project

Since you already have a project structure with `pages/Customers.tsx`, `App.tsx`, and `redux/`, you can integrate this code as follows:

1.  **Copy the UI Logic**: The `pages/Accounts.tsx` and `pages/AccountDetail.tsx` files contain the exact UI and logic you requested.
2.  **Data Layer**:
    *   If you are using **Redux**, you should migrate the logic from `context/AccountsContext.tsx` into your Redux slices.
    *   Specifically, the state for `locations`, `categories`, and `accounts` should live in your store.
3.  **Routing**: Add the routes `/accounts` and `/account/:id` to your main `App.tsx` or router configuration.

## Regarding your question: "Which files shall I share?"

To fully integrate this into your specific existing setup, I would ideally need to see:

1.  **`types.ts`**: To match your existing data models (if any) with the new `Account` and `Transaction` types.
2.  **`App.tsx`**: To see your current Routing setup so I can add the new pages correctly.
3.  **`redux/store.ts`** (or your root reducer): To see where to add the new `accountsSlice` if you want persistent global state.

However, the code provided in this response is fully functional as a module. You can copy the `pages` and `context` folders into your project and wrap the `Accounts` route with the `AccountsProvider` to get started immediately.
